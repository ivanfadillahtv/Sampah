Code Versioning 101 (Github) - 1st Session 


Code versioning is an essential practice in software development that allows teams to keep track of changes made to their codebase over time. In this training, the CDE Team rovided comprehensive insights into Git and GitHub, highlighting their significance in facilitating collaborative coding. This training covered key aspects such as code versioning, Git branching, Git merging, Git pull requests, and more.

Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in GitHub that contribute significantly to the code versioning process. Here's a brief overview of each:

Branching: Branches in GitHub are used to create separate paths of development. They enable developers to work on features or fixes without directly affecting the main codebase. By creating branches, team members can isolate their work and collaborate more efficiently. You can create a new branch using the command git branch <branch_name> and switch to it using git checkout <branch_name>.

Merging: Merging in GitHub integrates changes from one branch into another. It is a crucial step in combining different lines of development. You can use the command git merge <branch_name> to incorporate changes from one branch into another. In case of any conflicting changes, Git will prompt you to resolve them before completing the merge.

Understanding these concepts and using them effectively can greatly enhance collaboration and streamline the development process within a GitHub repository. They enable teams to work on different features simultaneously and merge their changes seamlessly when necessary.
