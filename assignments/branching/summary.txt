Branching on Git

Branching in Git allows for the creation of separate lines of development within a repository. This feature enables developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. By creating branches, individuals can isolate their work and collaborate more effectively. Git branches can be created, switched between, merged, and deleted as needed, facilitating a structured and organized approach to software development. Regularly utilizing branches can promote a systematic workflow and facilitate efficient collaboration among team members.
