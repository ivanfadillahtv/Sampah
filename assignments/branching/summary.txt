Branching on Git

Branching in Git allows for the creation of separate lines of development within a repository. 
This feature enables developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. 
By creating branches, individuals can isolate their work and collaborate more effectively. 
Git branches can be created, switched between, merged, and deleted as needed, facilitating a structured and organized approach to software development. 
Regularly utilizing branches can promote a systematic workflow and facilitate efficient collaboration among team members.

GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for managing branches.
Users can easily create new branches, switch between existing branches, 
merge changes from one branch to another, and delete branches when they are no longer needed. 
By leveraging these features, developers can maintain a clear and structured workflow, fostering efficient collaboration and effective version control within a project.
