Merging on Git

Merging in Git involves integrating changes from one branch into another, 
enabling the consolidation of different lines of development. The process 
typically includes checking out the target branch, merging the source branch, 
resolving any conflicts, committing the merge, and pushing the changes 
to the remote repository. Careful handling of the merging process is crucial, 
especially in collaborative environments, to ensure smooth integration without conflicts. 
Regularly updating and synchronizing branches can help minimize potential issues during the merging process.

We need to do pull request first to get the review before merging the changes.
